# Train NEP

## 1. Using the Training Page
The training page provides a streamlined workflow for launching NEP model training directly from the GUI.  After selecting a dataset you can configure basic parameters such as the number of steps and output directory.  Press **Start** to begin training; progress is shown in the log area and you can pause or stop the job at any time.

## 2. SSH Options
Training can run on remote machines via SSH.  Enable the *Use SSH* option and provide the remote host, port, user name and the path to your NEP environment.  Files are transferred automatically and the remote job output is displayed in the same log window.

## 3. Plotting Features
Once training is underway the page displays realâ€‘time plots of the energy and force errors.  You can open the plotting panel from the toolbar to review trends, zoom in on regions of interest and save the figures for later analysis.
